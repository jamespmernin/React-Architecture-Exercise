## Getting Started

1. Fork
2. Clone

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Create nice diagrams that give clarity into the architecture of a react app
- Have knowledge of how to use a diagram tool like whimsical

# Exercise: Create a diagram

Your task is to use [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com) to create a beautiful diagram. 

Some thoughts to contemplate as you create your react diagram:

What is the component hierarchy in this app?
- For example, the App component calls which components? And those components call what components? This should be clear in the diagram.

How do I differentiate a "screen" component vs a component in the components folder? Different color perhaps?

How am I diagramming the Layout component since it uses `props.children`?

How am I diagramming the services in this app? Is it clear which component uses which service?
- For example, the Products component uses the `getProducts()` service

**When done:**

1. Create a Pull Request
2. Include your Whimsical diagram shareable link in the pull request description
3. Make sure to toggle the "Enable Public Link Access" so we can have access to your diagram
